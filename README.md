# Website

I'm reworking my old website to a new awesome Gatsby based one! Currently it's still in preview, but feel free to poke around the source code.

## Features

- Progressive Web App
- Offline support
- Hot-reloading in development mode
- Automatic code formatting on commit

## Getting Started

First, install all required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then to start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Which will open a development environment with hot-reloading at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).
